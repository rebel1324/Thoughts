## 'Install Pylint' in VSCode, something never work
When I press Install Pylint, I always press it with doubt. Will it work? Will it make my life easier? The answer was always no and it never will be yes.

After painstakingly long hours of figuring out how to download pylint, finally i was able to rig pylint to vscode. I guess that's why they made a button 'Request Purchase of PyCharm' in our network.
